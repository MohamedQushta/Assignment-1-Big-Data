## Notes to run the image

1. run docker build -t {image_name} . ---> to build the docker image, run this command inside the git main repo when you clone it
2. docker run -it {image_name} ---> runs the container and opens a bash shell inside the container
3. (in the container shell) ---> make sure you're on the /home/doc-bd-a1 directory 
4. ls to check if the dataset is copied into the container directory
